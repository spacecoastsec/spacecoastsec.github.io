## Welcome to SpaceCoastSec

SpaceCoastSec (aka DC321, DEF CON Group 321) is an information security community serving the Space Coast area of Florida in Brevard County. We meet the third Tuesday of each month at 6:30PM EST unless otherwise notified via our Meetup page.  All tech talk meetings are held virtually. Our friends over at Space Coast Cyber hold an informal social meetup at a local business each month, see their meetup page for details. Our groups welcome everyone to attend our meetups whether working in information security or not.

The mission of this community is to provide a free, vendor-neutral forum for the expansion and dissemination of industry knowledge through presentations, outreach, and other educational activities; to extend the culture of security awareness in the communities we serve; and enable members to make informed, educated security decisions. SpaceCoastSec is a community where the public and anyone who works, plans to work, or provides a service in the information security area, can come to ask questions, seek advice, talk to other professionals, and keep up with the latest ideas and newest technology.
