## Welcome to SpaceCoastSec

Space Coast Infosec Community (aka SpaceCoastSec) is the premier information security community serving the Space Coast area of Florida in Brevard County. We meet the second Wednesday of each month at 6:30PM EST unless otherwise notified via our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/spacecoastsec/) page.  Our group welcomes everyone to attend our meetups whether working in information security or not.

The mission of this community is to provide a free, vendor-neutral forum for the expansion and dissemination of industry knowledge through presentations, outreach, and other educational activities; to extend the culture of security awareness in the communities we serve; and enable members to make informed, educated security decisions. SpaceCoastSec is a community where the public and anyone who works, plans to work, or provides a service in the information security area, can come to ask questions, seek advice, talk to other professionals, and keep up with current events and new technology.
