Name: Caleb Winslow

Caleb Winslow is the CEO of NeoTech. NeoTech was founded in the early 21st century as a small startup company specializing in advanced technology. The company quickly gained a reputation for being innovative and forward-thinking, and soon became one of the most successful and influential companies in the world. Over the years, NeoTech has expanded its operations to include a global and space presence. The company has developed a wide range of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space exploration. Despite its success, NeoTech has also been the subject of controversy and criticism. The company has been accused of being ruthless and ambitious, and of being willing to do whatever it takes to achieve its goals. Many people believe that NeoTech is a dangerous and powerful entity that poses a threat to the safety and well-being of the world. NeoTech has most recently been under investigation for being involved in a variety of illegal and unethical activities, including the development of weapons and the exploitation of resources on other planets. No one has found evidence of these activities yet and some say NeoTech has the ability to hide evidence in plain sight!

Maya stumbled upon some of these activities while investigating a cyber attack on one of NeoTech's subsidiaries that Sophia and her company had contracted with. She was able to trace the attack back to a server located in a NeoTech's main data center, which led her to suspect that the attack was not just a random hacking incident. As she dug deeper, she found that the server was being used for a variety of nefarious activities, including money laundering, illegal arms trafficking, and other criminal enterprises. She also discovered that the server was being controlled by a group of individuals who were using advanced encryption, steganography, and other security measures to keep their activities hidden. Maya's investigation led her to suspect that the group was secret society long thought by the Convenant to have disbanded, and she began to investigate their activities further. She discovered that the group was using advanced technology developed by NeoTech to control the minds of their members, and that they were using their influence and power to manipulate and control others as well. Maya's discovery of the activities was a major breakthrough in her investigation, and it led her to uncover a much larger conspiracy involving NeoTech, its CEO and a secret society. She took this information back to the Covenant to continue her investigation. It looked like there was something much more dangerous and sinister at play here.
