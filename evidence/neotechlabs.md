The subsidiary of NeoTech that owned the server was NeoTech Labs, a research and development arm of the company. NeoTech Labs was responsible for developing and testing new technologies, including the advanced encryption and security systems. The server was located in a secure facility owned and operated by NeoTech, the parent company. The NeoTech Labs facility was equipped with state-of-the-art security systems, including biometric scanners, motion sensors, and encryption algorithms. The server was also protected by a team of highly trained security personnel, who were responsible for monitoring the system 24/7 and responding to any security incidents. Despite the advanced security measures in place, Maya was able to infiltrate the facility and access the server remotely since she appears like a regular user on the NeoTech Labs network. Her skills and expertise allowed her to bypass the security systems and gain access to the server's data. 

Once inside the server, Maya discovered a vast amount of information about the secret society and its activities and confirmed it was indeed the Brotherhood of Eternal Night, long thought to have been disbanded. She found documents detailing the group's beliefs, rituals, and practices, as well as records of their financial transactions and communications. Maya's discovery of the Brotherhood's activities was a major breakthrough in the Covenant's investigation. She was able to use the information she found on the server to piece together the Brotherhood's operations and identify its leader as none other than Caleb Winslow! Before leaving, Maya quickly stashed a breadcrumb for Sophia in the NeoTech Labs image.
