Name: Peter Winslow

Peter knows he must warn Maya and Sophia about his father's plan to summon Azathoth during the eclipse, as he believes it will lead to the destruction of the human race. However, he also knows his father is a powerful and influential man, and he will not take kindly to Peter betraying his trust. 

Peter decides to warn Maya and Sophia in secret, using a hidden message only they will understand. He knows they are both intelligent and resourceful, and they will be able to decipher the message and take action to stop his father's plan. 

Peter creates a fake email account and sends a message to Maya and Sophia, pretending to be an anonymous source. 

Maya and Sophia are both puzzled and intrigued by a secret message they receive in email, and to their surprise they quickly realize it is from the tipster, who is Peter, that sent the tip to the Conclave to investigate the library. In the message, Peter uses a series of cryptic hints and references that they are able to solve, warning them about his father's plan to summon Azathoth during the eclipse. Further he warns them to be careful, his father is the CEO of NeoTech and is working with the secret society Brotherhood of the Eternal Night. He fears to say more over email and proposes to meet somewhere in public, including his picture so they can identify him. Before deleting the email and picture to protect Peter's identity they find one more piece of data in the photo.
